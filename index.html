    <h2>Selecting a Game</h2>

    <p>
      Use the on screen menu to select a game.
      The menu contains on-screen prompts, but here are some gotchas.
    </p>

    <h3>Selecting from Lists</h3>

    <p>
      Use the joystick to move to different items in the list.
      Move the joystick to the left and right to page up and page down, respectively.
      Select items with the <span class="text-success">A</span> button, which is the upper button closest to the joystick.
    </p>

    <h3>Search and Browse</h3>

    <p>
      Press the <span class="text-success">Player 1</span> button to get a menu with options to browse by recents and other categories.
      You can also use this menu to search, buy you might have better luck searching with <a href="/arcade-list">web list</a>.
